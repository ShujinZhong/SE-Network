# SE-Network

This repo implements Squeeze and Excitation Network proposed in publication [Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507). Resnet50 and Resnet110 with and without SE-network are implemented from scratch. Multi-class image classification tasks on [Oxford Pet](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) and [Cifar10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) datasets are performed using the implemented networks. The results demonstrate consistent improvement of classification accuracy by adding SE-network.
